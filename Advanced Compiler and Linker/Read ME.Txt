These Two Programs Allow you to have complete control 
over how your project is compiled and linked
I originally  had a linker in with my Make Windows DLL 
files submission this is newer than the linker helper 
provided with that

Advanced linker allows you to:
Change or add commands going to the linker to change 
the base address, file name, entry point, even make 
console programs, and change the version of windows 
your program will run on and just about everything 
else C++ lets you change.

Advanced Compiler allows you to:
Add or Remove Commands Going to the compiler
to change to Multi Threaded applications, Processor 
optimizations, stack probes and just about everything 
C++ lets you change. Even an option to save all .obj 
and intermediate files from your program

Well documented and brings up a switches window when you 
don't supply arguments, with all the possible switches you may use.

Simply add CMDFILE.TXT to your programs directory to supply 
linker arguments. Add COMPFILE.TXT to your programs 
directory to add or remove Compiler arguments.

Link makes a log of the linkers output and all commands 
sent before and after (use /Verbose in CMDFILE.TXT to see each pass)

C2 Makes a log of the compiler Output and commands before and 
after for each file anytime COMPFILE.TXT is present in the 
programs directory and with the *-Save switch it'll save all 
files to a directory named 'Obj Files'.

These programs just 'intercept' the commands to the linker and 
compiler from the IDE allowing you to change or add commands.

Take Complete Control over your IDE today
after compiling and adding the Linker and Compiler to your VB Directory 
(Rename C2.exe to C3.exe and Link.exe to LinkLnk.exe First!).

Comments Appreciated!
